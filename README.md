# Frontend Coding Challenge

Hello there, thanks again for your interest in Trade Republic. To kick off the
interview process we have prepared a short coding exercise for you, to demonstrate your knowledge of the language and tools we use to develop our web applications.

**Please note: The coding test should show that you feel comfortable working with any JavaScript framework. We use Vue.js and prefer it but you can use another framework if you feel that it will better show off your skills. The assessment of your submission will not change if you use a different framework.**

In case you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your dedicated recruiter.

## Context

Developing our app, we work with a REST API as well as real-time streaming market
data to display the latest stock prices with millisecond latency. You should feel
comfortable developing an app to address these two types of network interaction. The WebSocket server youâ€™ll be using accepts and emits messages in JSON format.

## Things we care for:

âœ… Unit tests

âœ… Semantic HTML

âœ… Responsive Design

âœ… Documentation

âœ… Accessibility

## Nice to have:

ðŸ¤© Use of Reactive programming libraries like RxJS.

### Glossary

We donâ€™t expect you to be a trading expert and some of the terms are quite specific to the space. Hereâ€™s some of the terms we use in the task:
| Term | Definition |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ISIN` | The 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a specific instrument |
| `instrument` | A tradable asset, or a negotiable item, such as a security, commodity, derivative, or index, or any item that underlies a derivative. |
| `bid` | The highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of shares of an instrument at any given time. |
| `ask` | The lowest price at which a seller will sell the instrument. |

## The Application

In the interest of saving you some time, we provided a working [Vue](https://vuejs.org) application. This application also includes a small set of components for you to use. Please note, using these components is optional, you are welcome to change them in any way you want, you should only submit something you are comfortable with.

## Using this application

### Pre-requisites

Please make sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org) 16 installed.

### Running the code

Once you have unzipped the folder and are ready to start, you can run `yarn` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies. After that, you can run:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# or yarn
yarn dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. It will also start the WebSocket server on port 8425. 

You can see the client application running in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.

## Task Description

In this repository we have provided you with a minimal [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) application. Your task is to extend this app so that it allows a user to subscribe/unsubscribe to a list of stocks. The user should be able to subscribe to a stock by entering its [ISIN](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isin.asp) number into an input and then see the current price of the stock displayed in a list view.

What we would like to see is clean, readable code that you would be **comfortable submitting to your colleagues for review**. Please explain decisions that youâ€™ve made and what you would do if you had more time to continue development. You can add them to this `README.md` file.

Requirements:

- We want to see how you interpret [user stories](#user-stories) into a solution, please fulfill all of the stories provided.
- Please avoid using a UI library, we want to be able to see your styling skills.
- We recommend using Vue but you can use a different framework if you feel that youâ€™ll be able to demonstrate your skills better.
- Great user experience is important to us at Trade Republic. Please approach the challenge from a userâ€™s perspective and build something you would be happy to put into userâ€™s hands.
- Please also provide setup instructions and answer the following [questions](#questions) in your README.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a form that allows a user to submit an ISIN and add it to a watch list.

#### User Stories

> As a user, I should be able to submit an ISIN and it should be added to my watch list.

> As a user, I should not be able to subscribe to the same ISIN twice so that I donâ€™t get confused by seeing multiple versions of the same stock.

> As a user, I should not be able to subscribe to an empty or invalid ISIN.

> Validation rules: An ISIN is a 12-character alphanumeric code. It consists of three parts: A two letter country code, a nine character alpha-numeric national security identifier, and a single check digit.
> Example:- US0378331005.

### Task 2

Create the UI and render the watch list created in the previous task to the DOM.

#### User Stories

> As a user, I should be able to view a list of my subscribed stocks displaying the latest stock price received from the WebSocket connection so that I can keep track of multiple stocks at the same time.

> As a user, I should be able to unsubscribe from a stock thatâ€™s in my watch list so that I can focus on the stocks Iâ€™m interested in.

> As a user, I should be notified if the websocket disconnects and the data is not up to date so that I know that the price is not accurate.

> As a user, I should be able to view their stocks on desktop and mobile screen widths so that I am able to use the app on my mobile browser.

### Task 3

At this point, you can consider the challenge to be complete.

This task is intentionally left open for you to add any feature you want to the application. Anything is valid, from improvements to Accessibility all the way to UI Transitions, CSS, etc.

For this part, 
Here are the extra features:
- Accessibility - currently at 100% using Lighthouse.
- Data Persistence -  session storage is used to save the user's watchlist during the sessions.

## Socket Reference

The WebSocket server is started when you run `yarn dev`. You can then connect to it at

```URL
ws://localhost:8425/
```

To subcribe to a specific security

```JSON
{
    "subscribe": "${ISIN}"
}
```

To unsubscribe to a specific security

```JSON
{
    "unsubscribe": "${ISIN}"
}
```

#### Example Request

To subscribe to the BASF instrument you would use

```JSON
{
    "subscribe": "DE000BASF111"
}
```

#### Sample Response

You would then receive a WebSocket stream with messages in the following format

```JSON
{
    "isin": "DE000BASF111",
    "price": 11.316359370403822,
    "bid": 11.306359370403822,
    "ask": 11.326359370403821
}
```

## Questions

1. What happens in case the WebSocket disconnects? How would you go further to keep the live data available or inform the user? Please discuss the challenges.
   
   *Answer*
     The connection status is updated to "disconnected" in the UI, informing the user that the connection has been lost, and also a warning message is displayed notifying the user that the  data may no longer be up to date.

2. What happens if a user adds an instrument multiple times to their list? Please discuss possible challenges and mitigations.

    *Answer*

    Challenge: Allowing a user to add an instrument multiple times to their list can lead to significant challenges, including cluttered UI, increased network traffic, performance degradation. 

    Migation: The app currently prevents duplicate subscriptions by checking if an ISIN already exists in the stocks list before adding a new one. If the ISIN is already present, the user is notified through an error message that the ISIN already exist and so the user is not allowed to add the same instrument again.

3. What potential performance issues might you face when this app scales with multiple subscriptions? How would you improve the speed and user experience?
    *Answer*
    The potential performance issues might include:
    -  Rendering a large list of stocks with frequent updates can cause the browser to struggle thereby causing a lag or delay in loading data
    - Multiple subscriptions increase the amount of data being transferred over the network so users may face slowdowns due to network congestion
    - Storing data for a large number of subscribed stocks consumes memory and therefore it might crash or cause the browser to slow down

To improve users experience:
- Adding debouncing on the implementation to ensure that updates are processed at a manageable rate.
- Implement skeleton screens or placeholder content while data is loading.
- Add sorting and filtering features to help users manage large lists.
- Add debouncing to the ISIN input to reduce unnecessary validation calls.

### Implementation Documentation

- [Features](#features)
- [Components](#components)
- [Key accessibility improvements](#key-accessibility-improvements)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Running the Unit Test](#running-the-unit-test)


#### Features
- Add Stocks to Watchlist: Users can add stocks to their watchlist by entering a valid ISIN.
- Remove Stocks from Watchlist: Users can remove stocks from their watchlist.
- Prevent Duplicate Subscriptions: The app prevents users from adding the same stock multiple times.
- Real-Time Price Updates: The app receives live updates for subscribed stocks via a WebSocket connection and displays the latest price, bid, and ask values.
- WebSocket Connection: The app handles WebSocket disconnections by notifying users when the connection is lost and attempting automatic reconnection.

#### Components
- Header.vue:   Displays the application header.
- TextField.vue:    A custom input component used for entering ISINs.
- Button.vue:   A custom button component used across the application.
- StockForm.vue:    A form component where users enter an ISIN to subscribe to a stock. It includes validation to ensure the ISIN is correctly formatted and not a duplicate.
- StockList.vue: Displays a list of subscribed stocks in a table format, showing the ISIN, price, bid, and ask values. Users can remove stocks from the list using the remove button. The component also indicates the connection status and handles situations where the WebSocket is disconnected.


#### Key accessibility improvements:
- Use of role, scope, aria-label to enhance description of elements for screen readers. Accessibility is currently at 100% using google lighthouse.

- Session Storage: was used to persisit user's watchlist. Session storage was used so that after the session, the watchlist would no longer be persisted in the browser.


#### Testing
The app includes unit tests that ensure the core functionality works as expected:

- Form validation tests ensure that users can only add valid ISINs and that duplicates are not allowed.
- Stock list tests ensure that stocks are correctly rendered in a table, that the UI updates with the correct data, and that the remove functionality works as intended.
- WebSocket tests verify that the connection is properly managed, that stocks are added/removed correctly, and that updates are handled efficiently.


#### Running the Unit Test

```bash
yarn test
